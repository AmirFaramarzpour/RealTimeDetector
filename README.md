About OpenCV:
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It contains a comprehensive set of tools for image processing, video capture, and analysis, enabling developers to build complex computer vision applications easily. OpenCV supports various programming languages and platforms, making it a popular choice for both academic and industrial projects.

About YOLO:
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. YOLOv8, the latest version, improves upon previous versions with enhanced performance, accuracy, and speed. It can detect multiple objects within an image or video frame simultaneously, making it ideal for applications ranging from security systems to autonomous driving. YOLO's architecture allows it to process images in real-time, which is essential for applications requiring immediate response.

Available object detection initialization options are:
yolov8n.pt - nano (3.2M parameters)
yolov8s.pt - small (11.2M parameters)
yolov8m.pt - medium (25.9M parameters)
yolov8l.pt - large (43.7M parameters)
yolov8x.pt - extra-large (68.2M parameters)
